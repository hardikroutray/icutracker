## HOSPITAL BED TRACKER

#### Under Development

This the github repo for the application [icubedtracker](https://icubedtracker.herokuapp.com). This application intends to provide the user with latest hospital data directly gathered from government websites in various states. The data includes total number of available regular, oxygen and ICU beds and more. The application has also an inbuilt map feature that helps the user to determine the nearest hospitals with vacant beds. More features are going to be included soon.
